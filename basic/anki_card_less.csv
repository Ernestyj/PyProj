What is Hamming Code?	In telecommunication, Hamming codes are a family of linear error-correcting codes that generalize the Hamming(7,4)-code, and were invented by Richard Hamming in 1950. Hamming codes can detect up to two-bit errors or correct one-bit errors without detection of uncorrected errors.

How many levels in a complete binary tree of size n?	floor(1 + log(base2)(n))
How can build heap be done in linear time?	"A tree of size n nodes, will have floor(n/2^h) nodes with height >= h.
The last half of nodes will be leaves, so they already satisfy the heap property. No work needs to be done on them.
going bottom-up (ignoring the last n/2 items) and satisfying the heap property one level at a time, each level going up the tree has to do at most 1 operation more than the level below it. But as you go up the tree, higher levels have fewer nodes, so you may be doing more operations, but it happens on fewer number of times.
This resembles a series:

n/2 - height 1: 1 operations
n/4 - height 2: 2 operation
n/8 - height 3: 3 operations
...
going to floor(n/2^h) - height h: h operations

What is typical cache line size?	"64 bytes.

-- extra below --

To know the sizes, you need to look it up using the documentation for the processor, afaik there is no programatic way to do it. On the plus side however, most cache lines are of a standard size, based on intels standards. On x86 cache lines are 64 bytes, however, to prevent false sharing, you need to follow the guidelines of the processor you are targeting (intel has some special notes on its netburst based processors), generally you need to align to 64 bytes for this (intel states that you should also avoid crossing 16 byte boundries).

To do this in C or C++ requires that you use aligned_malloc or one of the compiler specific specifiers such as __attribute__((align(64))) or __declspec(align(64)). To pad between members in a struct to split them onto different cache lines, you need on insert a member big enough to align it to the next 64 byte boundery"
What is latency?	Latency is the delay from input into a system to desired outcome. The time interval between between a stimulus and response.
What is a y-fast trie?	A y-fast trie is a data structure for storing integers from a bounded domain. It supports exact and predecessor or successor queries in time O(log log M), using O(n) space, where n is the number of stored values and M is the maximum value in the domain. The structure was proposed by Dan Willard in 1982 to decrease the O(n log M) space used by an x-fast trie.
What is an x-fast trie?	An x-fast trie is a data structure for storing integers from a bounded domain. It supports exact and predecessor or successor queries in time O(log log M), using O(n log M) space, where n is the number of stored values and M is the maximum value in the domain. The structure was proposed by Dan Willard in 1982, along with the more complicated y-fast trie, as a way to improve the space usage of van Emde Boas trees, while retaining the O(log log M) query time.
What is a van Emde Boas tree?	"The van Emde Boas tree supports insertions, deletions, lookups, successor queries, and predecessor queries in time O(log log U), where U is the universe of items to store. Items are stored in clusters of size sqrt(U). 

The van Emde Boas data structure divides the range {0,...,n−1} into blocks of size sqrt(n), which we call clusters. Each cluster is itself a vEB structure of size sqrt(n). In addition, there is a “summary” structure that keeps track of which clusters are nonempty.

More detail:
A van Emde Boas tree (or van Emde Boas priority queue), also known as a vEB tree, is a tree data structure which implements an associative array with m-bit integer keys. It performs all operations in O(log m) time, or equivalently in O(log log M) time, where M = 2m is the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the tree. The M is not to be confused with the actual number of elements stored in the tree, by which the performance of other tree data-structures is often measured. The vEB tree has good space efficiency when it contains a large number of elements, as discussed below. It was invented by a team led by Dutch computer scientist Peter van Emde Boas in 1975."
What is a compressed trie?	It's a trie where the non-branching paths are compacted into a single edge.

In what case would perfect hashing be practical?	When you don't need to support inserts or deletes. The data is static.
How does perfect hashing handle collisions?	It creates a second hash table in the buckets where there are multiple items (k), using a second hash function, and k^2 space. The hash table has two hashing levels. k^2 is chosen because the Markov inequality (birthday paradox) ensures we will not have collisions in bucket.
What is the optimal load factor for a hash table?	O(sqrt(n))
What is the expected load factor for a hash table?	n/m,  where n = items, m = buckets) n/m is also called alpha.
What is the technical running time for operations on a hash table?	O(1 + alpha), where alpha is the load factor (n/m). Table doubling operations are amortized.
What is the worst-case search time of perfect hashing?	O(1)
What is the worst-case space required for perfect hashing?	O(n)

What are the downsides of using an adjacency matrix to represent a graph?	"Finding all the outgoing edges from a vertex takes O(n) time even if there aren't very many, and the O(n^2) space cost is high for ""sparse graphs,"" those with much fewer than n^2 edges."
When is using an adjacency list expensive?	Finding predecessors of a node u is extremely expensive, requiring looking through every list of every node in time O(n + e), where e is the total number of edges, although if this is something we actually need to do often we can store a second copy of the graph with the edges reversed.
When are adjacency lists most useful?	Adjacency lists are most useful when we mostly want to enumerate outgoing edges of each node. This is common in search tasks, where we want to find a path from one node to another or compute the distances between pairs of nodes. If other operations are important, we can optimize them by augmenting the adjacency list representation; for example, using sorted arrays for the adjacency lists reduces the cost of edge existence testing to O(log(d+ (u))), and adding a second copy of the graph with reversed edges lets us find all predecessors of u in O(d− (u)) time, where d− (u) is u's in-degree.

What can use to find if a graph is bipartite?	BFS. Using only 2 colors. When you encounter a new vertex, if it has no color, give it the opposite color of its parent vertex. If it is already colored the same, the graph is not bipartite.
How can you find a cycle in a graph?	DFS. If you discover an edge that connects to an ancestor (previously discovered vertex), you have a cycle.
What is an articulation vertex?	A vertex of a graph whose deletion disconnects the graph.
How can you find an articulation vertex?	"DFS multiple times. Remove each edge one at a time, doing a DFS after each, so see if you end up with > 1 connected components. If you remove a node and then DFS and find you have fewer than m - 1 edges, you've deleted an articulation vertex. O(n(n+m))

A faster way, with a little more bookkeeping, can be done in O(n+m) time, if you do DFS and keep track of parents and make a note when you reach a back edge, which connects to an ancestor."

When talking dynamic programming, what is optimality?	An algorithm has optimality if the subsolutions of an optimal solution of the problem are themsleves optimal solutions for their subproblems.
What is dynamic programming?	"Dynamic programming is a general-purpose algorithm design technique that is most often used to solve combinatorial optimization problems, where we are looking for the best possible input to some function chosen from an exponentially large search space.

There are two parts to dynamic programming. The first part is a programming technique: dynamic programming is essentially divide and conquer run in reverse: we solve a big instance of a problem by breaking it up recursively into smaller instances; but instead of carrying out the computation recursively from the top down, we start from the bottom with the smallest instances of the problem, solving each increasingly large instance in turn and storing the result in a table. The second part is a design principle: in building up our table, we are careful always to preserve alternative solutions we may need later, by delaying commitment to particular choices to the extent that we can.

The bottom-up aspect of dynamic programming is most useful when a straightforward recursion would produce many duplicate subproblems. It is most efficient when we can enumerate a class of subproblems that doesn't include too many extraneous cases that we don't need for our original problem."

What are some benefits of arrays?	"- Constant-time access given the index
- Space efficiency
- Memory locality"
Why is memory locality important?	Physical continuity between successive data accesses helps exploit the high-speed cache memory on modern computer architectures.
What are some advantages to linked lists over arrays?	"- Overflow on linked structures can never occur unless the memory is actually full.
- Insertions and deletions are simpler than for contiguous (array) lists.
- With large records, moving pointers is easier and faster than moving the items themselves."
What are some advantages to arrays over linked lists?	"- Linked structures require extra space for storing pointer fields.
- Linked lists do not allow efficient random access to items.

Codeless question: Give an algorithm for finding an ordered word pair (e.g., “New York”) occurring with the greatest frequency in a given webpage. Which data structures would you use?	"You could use a hash table, creating or updating an entry for each pair. 
Keep track of max_frequency and most_frequent_phrase.
Just increment the count, and when you see the new count is > than max_frequency, update max_frequency and most_frequent_phrase"
Codeless question: Given a set of n numbers, how do you find the pair of numbers that have the smallest difference between them?	Sort them: Once the numbers are sorted, the closest pair of numbers must lie next to each other somewhere in sorted order. Thus, a linear-time scan through them completes the job, for a total of O(n log n) time including the sorting.
Codeless question: Are there any duplicates in a given set of n items?	This is a special case of the closest-pair problem, where we ask if there is a pair separated by a gap of zero. The most efficient algorithm sorts the numbers and then does a linear scan though checking all adjacent pairs.
Codeless question: Given a set of n items, which element occurs the largest number of times in the set? Bonus: How do you find out how many times some element k appears?	"If the items are sorted, we can sweep from left to right and count them, since all identical items will be lumped together during sorting.

To find out how often an arbitrary element k occurs, look up k using binary search in a sorted array of keys. Then use binary search in each direction to find where that run of the number begins and ends."
Codeless question: Give an efficient algorithm to determine whether two sets (of size m and n, respectively) are disjoint.	"The small set can be sorted in O(m log m) time. We can now do a binary search with each of the n elements in the big set, looking to see if it exists in the small one. The total time will be O((n + m) log m).

This is better than sorting the larger array or sorting both sets and going through the list."

- Trees with parent and child pointers"
What is a weak reference in Python?	"A weak reference to an object does not affect its reference count. 
When the only remaining references to a referent are weak references, garbage collection is free to destroy the referent and reuse its memory for something else. A primary use for weak references is to implement caches or mappings holding large objects, where it’s desired that a large object not be kept alive solely because it appears in a cache or mapping."
How does garbage collection work in CPython?	"CPython uses reference counting and generational garbage collection. There are 3 age stages where objects live in memory. They all start in the ""nursery"", stage0, then if they survive a garbage collection, they are moved to stage1, the oldest objects that continue to survive in stage1 are promoted to stage2. The gc module has thresholds 700, 10, 10 for each stage. In order to decide when to run, the collector keeps track of the number object allocations and deallocations since the last collection. When the number of allocations minus the number of deallocations exceeds threshold0, collection starts. If generation 0 has been examined more than threshold1 times since generation 1 has been examined, then generation 1 is examined as well. Similarly, threshold2 controls the number of collections of generation 1 before collecting generation 2."
What is reference counting?	RC is a method of garbage collection. The runtime keeps track of references to an object by manipulating the reference count on each assignment and delete (del), and when the reference count reaches 0 it means the object is practically unreachable. When the next collection runs, the object's memory will be reserved to allocate for new objects.
What is a finalizer in Python?	A finalizer is a destructor, named __del__. __del__() is run when the runtime is about to destroy the object.
What are 2 advantages of reference counting?	"- easy to implement
- collects garbage incidentally without large pauses in execution."
What are 2 disadvantages of reference counting?	"- it cannot collect circular references
- manipulating reference counts at each assignment is very slow."
What is cyclic garbage collection?	Detects and removes cycles unreachable by the program.
How is garbage collection done in PyPy?	"The GC implementation can be chosen at runtime. It's pluggable.
PyPy uses mark and sweep, and generational gc optimization. Marked objects are promoted from the nursery to an older generation.
PyPy uses incremental garbage collection, where major collection is split into multiple passes, each lasting only a few milliseconds."
What is a pointer?	A pointer is a memory address stored in memory.
How does mark and sweep work?	(In Java) Perform a DFS on the graph of references to objects. This graph can have multiple roots. Each root is a reference that the program can access directly, such as a variable. Traverse the graph, setting a mark bit in each object. The sweep phase causes unmarked memory to be linked together in a list, so that memory can be reallocated. Sometimes this also triggers compaction, which moves used objects adjacent to each other in memory. The side effect of this is that free memory is also adjacent to free memory so large blocks can be allocated.
What is copying garbage collection (stop and copy)?	Heap memory is split into 2 partitions: an old space and a new space. Find live objects by DFS of their reference graph, and move live objects into the new space. The new space is now called the old space. Unreachable objects are simply left in the old space to be overwritten the next time collection occurs. The movement of objects implicitly compacts the objects. Disadvantage: you can only use half of the heap space.
How could you implement an LRU cache?	"A fast lookup table, like a hash table or binary tree, and a linked list of items by use. When you access or add an item, you delete it from the linked list and add it to the head of the list.  Then to prune, traverse the linked list and remove trailing elements, and delete them from the storage (tree or hash table).
You can also use a splay tree, since it moves accesses to the root. To prune items, somehow find and remove the leaves, since the number of leaves will be about n/2."
What is a direct mapped cache?	It's a type of cache used in the CPU, where the lower order bits of a given memory address are used modulo the number of cache lines to place or lookup in the cache. Collisions are treated as overwrites.
What is a fully-associative cache?	"It's a type of cache used in the CPU, where lookups are done on all cache lines in parallel to determine a hit or miss.

This requires a very large number of comparators that increase the complexity and cost of implementing large caches. Therefore, this type of cache is usually only used for small caches, typically less than 4K."
Disadvantage of a fully-associative cache?	"- expensive due to parallel checks
- complexity of implementing this scheme"
How do some processors handle caching for data and instructions?	There will be a slightly slower (3-4 clocks latency) separate cache for data.
What is an N-way set associative cache?	A Set-Associative cache scheme is a combination of Fully-Associative and Direct Mapped caching schemes. A set-associate scheme works by dividing the cache SRAM into equal sections (2 or 4 sections typically) called cache ways. The cache page size is equal to the size of the cache way. Each cache way is treated like a small direct mapped cache.
Describe the memory hierarchy of a Core i7 processor.	"Inside of each core is a 32 kB L1 instruction cache, a 32 kB L1 data cache (it's 8-way set associative), and a dedicated 256 kB L2 cache (also 8-way set associative). 
Outside of the cores is the L3, which is much larger at 8 MB and smarter (16-way associative) than the L2s."

What is a MAC?	MAC is a message authentication code used to provide a checksum for a message, sent along with the message to provide confidence that the message has not been tampered.
How does RSA work?	It's a public/private key cryptography method. The public key can be used to encrypt a message into ciphertext that only the owner of the key can decrypt.

- target collision resistant
- non-malleable"
If a one-way function is collision-resistant, does that mean it's also target collision-resistant?	Yes.
If a one-way function is target collision-resistant, does that mean it's also collision-resistant?	No.
What is symmetric key encryption?	There is a known encryption function, and one key is used to encrypt and decrypt. The key has to be shared between 2 parties.
How does Diffie-Hellman key exchange work?	2 parties agree on a G and a modulus p, and each party comes up with a number. One party does G^a and the other G^b. They pass this information. One party A computes the key from B as B^a mod p. B computes A^b mod p to get the key.
Is Diffie-Hellman key exchange perfect?	No. A man in the middle can intercept one side, and communicate with parties A and B independently.
How is RSA (using product of large primes) better than using NP-Complete algorithms for encryption?	NP-Complete algorithms are hard in the worst case, but can be sometimes solved in linear time in the average case. Compositing the product of large primes is hard in the average case.
What is Vigenere cipher?	"Improvement on Caesar cipher. Letters are shifted based on a shifted dictionary. ""Polyalphabetic cipher"""
What is a one-time pad encryption?	"The ""perfect"" simple encryption scheme. Pad/key is the same size as the message being encrypted. The key is randomly generated and xored against the plain text. Or key used to determine the amount each letter should be shifted."
What is block size in cryptography?	Symmetric key ciphers are generally divided into stream ciphers and block ciphers. Block ciphers operate on a fixed length string of bits. The length of this bit string is the block size. Both the input (plaintext) and output (ciphertext) are the same length; the output cannot be shorter than the input – this is logically required by the Pigeonhole principle and the fact that the cipher must be invertible – and it is simply undesirable for the output to be longer than the input.
What is the limiting factor of compression?	For lossless compression, it's entropy. For lossy compression, it's our acceptance with the amount of loss.
What is LZ* compression based on?	Cataloging the positions and lengths of redundant patterns and combining the values with a dictionary.

What is DEFLATE?	It's an lossless compression algorithm based on LZ77 used in Gzip, WinZip, and mod_deflate, which is bundled with Apache web server for automated gzip compression of HTTP served content. It uses LZ77 and Huffman coding.
How does LZ77-based compression work?	"LZ77 is a dictionary encoding algorithm, which is a statistical encoding algorithm. Compression in the LZ77 algorithm is based on the notion that strings of characters (words, phrases, etc.) occur repeatedly in the message being compressed.

The input is partitioned into 2 segments: a search buffer and a look-ahead buffer. The search buffer maxes out at 32KB. Starting with one character in the LA buffer, it looks back in the search buffer to find a copy of the symbol. If one is found, it looks at the second symbol of the LA buffer to see if it also matches the predecessor. Using this method, it can detect long phrases of symbols and encode them as one unit.

This process implicitly creates a rolling statistical probability for each symbol/phrase."
What is Huffman encoding?	Huffman encoding algorithm analyzes the occurrence of individual symbols and creates a binary tree where the common symbols are closest to the root, using fewer bits to encode, and less common/rare symbols have longer paths on the tree, with longer encodings to accommodate. By traversing the tree, from root to leaf, and keeping track of 1 or 0 at each node, we can determine the encoding of the symbol.
What is the primary factor of compression?	Probability of redundant portions of input.
How can you maximize compression?	By deeply analyzing the given input to reduce redundancy as much as possible.
What compression scheme uses Burrows-Wheeler transform?	BZip2
What is the Burrows-Wheeler transform?	"It's a compression method involving the sorting of all possible rotations of the input text into lexicographic order. Take as output the last column and the index of the row that the original text appears in. 

To decode, take the single column and repeatedly add the final columns characters to each of the rows, sorting each time. Once you've reached the length of the column's height, use the index to find the output string."

What is dual-mode operation?	Hardware provides at least 2 modes: user mode and kernel (aka: supervisor, protected) mode.
How does the OS run a program?	It does an exec from kernel mode (system mode 1). We go to system mode 0, user mode. When the program exits, we switch back to kernel mode.
How does a user program interact with the kernel?	It makes a system call, and the kernel takes over, completes the action, and the kernel returns to the process (back to user mode).
What happens when the hardware needs something to happen?	It does an interrupt, and the kernel takes control, switches the process, and once hardware task is complete, does a return from interrupt back to user mode.
What happens when a program makes an exception?	The program terminates, and switches to kernel mode.
What is base and bound?	It's a memory addressing restriction where a processes are only allowed access to the memory between a base address and the bound + base addresses. Each process has its own base and bound. A drawback is you don't get address 0. Address translation fixes this.
How does the OS know how to handle an interrupt?	It keeps an interrupt vector in the memory of the OS. Each interrupt type is mapped to an address to execute. They are just pointers to code in the OS.
What is the difference between PC and uPC?	PC is the program counter for the current process. uPC is the PC of the user process we will return to once an interrupt or other OS process switches context.
How are base and bound enforced?	They are stored in registers. Access is restricted by the hardware.
How does x86 do segments and stacks?	Each process' individual segments (heap, stack, code, static data) get their own base and bound. They don't even need to be adjacent in memory and their location is hidden by memory addressing.
When a process forks, what happens?	"The process is paused, and a complete copy is made: code, stack, heap, data, program counter and registers.
The child and parent resume with returning from fork syscall."
What does fork() return?	It returns the child process id to the parent, and 0 to the child. < 0 if error.
What does wait() do?	Causes the parent process to pause until the child terminates.
What does exec() do?	It's a system call to change the currently running program to something else.

When a system call is made, where are parameters stored?	In registers.
What is a socket?	It's an abstraction of a network I/O queue.  It's a method of communication where a producer writes to one side, and a consumer reads from the other side. It's similar to writing and reading a file, but no file is involved.
What sockets are in modern use?	Local sockets to local machine, called UNIX sockets, and TCP/IP and UDP/IP.
What is the GIL?	It's the Global Interpreter Lock. It's is a part of CPython. It ensures only one thread runs in the interpreter at once. Having the GIL simplifies many low-level details (memory management, callouts to C extensions, etc.)
When is the GIL released?	During I/O (disk IO, network IO, output to display) including when a thread uses sleep.
"What is a ""tick"" in CPython?"	Approximately 1 machine instruction.
"What happens every 100 ""ticks"" in the CPython interpreter?"	A thread check occurs during which the thread releases the GIL then attempts to reacquire it. Other Python threads will contend for the the GIL. This is no longer the case in 3.4.
What is a lock in CPython?	It's a binary semaphore. It's not a mutex lock.
What happens when the heap gets too large?	It does a page fault, and the kernel will allocate more memory.
What happens when the heap and stack meet in memory?	A guard page is hit and the process is killed.
Where is information about a process stored?	In a PCB (process control block).
Where is information about a thread stored?	In a TCB (thread control block).
What do multiple threads in the same process share?	Heap, file descriptors, code, static data.
What do threads in a process NOT share?	Registers and stack.
What can happen with thread stacks if one goes into a deep recursion?	One thread's stack can grow into another thread's stack and write over it. A guard page can help to protect from that.
What can cause a thread to give control back to the dispatcher?	Thread returns control voluntarily (yield, requesting I/O (which blocks), wait for signal from another thread) or gets preempted by an interrupt.
How long does it take to do a process context switch?	3-4 microseconds.
How long does it take to perform a thread context switch?	100ns
How often do context switches happen?	Every 10-100 ms.

What happens in a system call to get the OS to switch to kernel mode?	A trap.
How many threads should you run per process?	One per core.
How is concurrency accomplished?	By multiplexing CPU time.

What is oversubscription?	Spawning more threads than available cores.
What is a race condition?	When the outcome of a deterministic procedure becomes non-deterministic based on differences in subprocess timing.
What can you put in place to exclusively use a resource without another process interfering?	A mutex, or even better, a lock guard.
How do you use a mutex in Python?	"import threading

lock = threading.Lock()

[first process]
global lock
lock.release()
...
[other process]
global lock
lock.acquire() // attempts to get access, waits if it can't"

What is a promise?	A promise to send a parameter to a child thread's function later.
What is livelock?	"It occurs when multiple processes are attempting to deal with the current state, but neither makes progress. This can happen when a system is attempting to resolve a deadlock situation but another or the same process continue to trigger it.
Starvation is another example."
How long does a terminated process stay in the terminated state?	Until the parent process does a wait to receive its exit code.
In Python, what can you use to fork a process?	The multiprocessing module. It supports process Pool and Process for making a pool of worker processes or forking temporary subprocesses.
What does the concurrent.futures module offer?	"ThreadPoolExecutor
ProcessPoolExecutor
Executor objects
Future objects"
What is an interrupt?	A hardware-invoked context switch. The interrupt handler always runs immediately.
What happens during an interrupt?	The currently running process' state is saved. We switch to kernel mode, the interrupt handler runs, and once its complete, the system goes back to user mode and the process continues.
What really happens when you fork a process?	A fork doesn't copy everything, it just duplicates the page table pointers, which are all set at read-only. Called copy-on-write. Once you write to memory, then it copies the state.
What is multiprocessing?	Parallel execution on multiple cores.
What does a PCB contain?	"Everything about a process:

What is special about an interrupt handler?	It disables interrupts and runs to completion.
What are the five states a process can be in?	"- new (when being created)
- ready
- running
- waiting (for I/O or event coordination)
- terminated (waits for parent process to receive its exit code)"
What is the difference between filter() and map()?	"Filter uses a function that returns true or false (predicate).
Map uses a function that returns a value."
What is synchronization?	Using atomic operations to ensure cooperation between threads.
What is a critical section?	A block of code that you lock before entering, then unlock when leaving. This creates a mutual exclusion on shared data.
What is the priority inversion problem?	A thread that is busy-waiting for a lock to be released ends up stealing CPU and getting a higher priority than the thread with the lock. SO since the waiting thread gets higher priority, the thread holding the lock can't complete and release the lock.
What is busy-waiting?	One or more threads is using a lot of CPU by continuously checking a value, or test&set() checking and writing a value in wiating for a lock to release, thus stealing CPU from the thread holding the lock.
What is a semaphore?	"A semaphore (defined by Dijkstra) is kind of signaling solution for handling concurrency data integrity problems that arise in multi-threaded applications. It has a non-negative integer that supports 2 operations:
- P() [proberen, to test/probe] - atomic operation that waits for semaphore to become > 1, then decrements it by 1 (wait)
- V() [verhogen, to increment] - an atomic operation that increments the semaphore by 1, waking up any P (signal)

The initial semaphore value will determine how many threads can run in the critical section at once."
What's another name for a mutual exclusion?	Binary semaphore.
What is a monitor?	A lock and zero or more condition variables for managing concurrent access to shared data.

It’s a toolkit that provides an actor model, runtime, and required supporting tools for building scalable applications."
What is an actor?	"Briefly, actors are a lot like message queues without the configuration and message broker installation overhead. They’re like programmable message queues shrunk to microsize—you can easily create thousands, even millions of them. They don’t “do”
anything unless they’re sent a message.
Messages are simple data structures that can’t be changed after they’ve been created, or in a single word, they’re immutable.
Actors can receive messages one at a time and execute some behavior whenever a message is received. Unlike queues, they can also send messages (to other actors).
Everything an actor does is executed asynchronously. Simply put, you can send a message to an actor without waiting for a response. Actors aren’t like threads, but messages sent to them are pushed through on a thread at some point in time. How actors are connected to threads is configurable - this is not a hardwired relationship.
For now the most important aspect of actors is that you build applications by sending and receiving messages. A message could be processed locally on some available thread, or remotely on another server. Exactly where the message is processed and where the actor lives are things you can decide later, which is very different compared to hardcoding threads and RPC style networking. Actors make it easy to build your application out of small parts that resemble networked services, only shrunk to microsize in footprint and administrative overhead."

When a module is imported for the first time, or when the source is more recent than the current compiled file, a .pyc file containing the compiled code will usually be created in the same directory as the .py file. When you run the program next time, Python uses this file to skip the compilation step.

What are some key things to remember when scaling a large system?	"1) Asynchronous is good  (use queues, topics/pub-sub)
2) Parallel is good  (multi-threading, load balancing etc.)
3) Avoid points of contention e.g. synchronization
4) Avoid writing to disk until you must - cache like crazy
5) Scale out not up
6) At web scale the speed of light is a problem
7) At web scale everything fails - networks, load balancers etc."
What is Thrift?	"Apache Thrift is a framework for scalable cross-language services development. It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between different languages. It handles serialization and has its own communication protocol.
IDL-based."
What is Memcache?	An in-memory distributed hash table. It supports only a few commands but it is extremely efficient.
How does/did Facebook use memcache and mySQL in 2009?	No joins in production. They have many logical databases for all of their types: people, events, place info, etc. They treat the web tier as a CPU, memcache as system memory, and the database as disk. Everything has an ID and you use the ID to query memcache using a multiget. Any misses are fetched from the database and cached in memcache.
What is an out-of-band cache?	A cache layer that does not synch with persistent storage. When changes are made to the database, there are no notifications to synchronize with the cache. The cache entry would need to be updated or evicted by other means.
What is a monad?	In functional programming, monads are a way to build computer programs by joining simple components in predictable and robust ways. A monad is a structure that represents computations defined as sequences of steps: a type with a monad structure defines what it means to chain operations together, or nest functions of that type. This allows the programmer to build pipelines that process data in a series of steps (i.e. a series of actions applied to the data), in which each action is decorated with additional processing rules provided by the monad. A monad is defined by a return operator that creates values, and a bind operator used to link the actions in the pipeline.
What is pyramidpypi?	A self-hosted mirror of pypi.
Big Omega represents what?	A lower bound on the growth of a function. f grows at least as fast as g.
Theta represents what?	A tight asymptotic bound on a function, in other words if both f and g have approximately the same rate of growth.
For graph problems, the complexity  Theta(N + M) is known as what?	linear in the graph size
"What is a better way of saying ""at least O(n^2)""?"	big Omega(n^2)
What is data normalization?	"Normalization is a systematic approach of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy and undesirable characteristics like insertion, update and deletion anomalies.

Normalization is used for mainly two purpose,
- eliminating redundant (useless) data
- ensuring data dependencies make sense"
What are the requirements for first normal form?	"- each cell has a single value
- all items in a column must be of the same type
- rows are uniquely identified by a unique ID or a composite key"
What are the requirements for second normal form?	All attributes (non-key columns) are dependent on the key
What are the requirements for third normal form?	All fields can only be determined by the key in the table and no other column.
What are the requirements for fourth normal form?	No multi-valued dependencies, meaning records should not be duplicated in a table just because more than one item is associated. This creates records that are duplicates except for one field.
What are some use cases of Hadoop?	"- reporting on user behavior over many events
- log processing of 100s of billions of rows"
What are some solid principles to keep in mind for scaling?	"- Keep it very simple
- Don’t re-invent the wheel
- Go with boring, proven and well-supported technologies when you can
- Build for what you will need over the next 12-18 months
- Make different things look the same
- Cache to protect the database
- Good enough is good enough"
What is gunicorn?	A Python WSGI HTTP Server
What is WSGI?	"WSGI is the Web Server Gateway Interface. It is a specification that describes how a web server communicates with web applications, and how web applications can be chained together to process one request. It was outlined in PEP 3333.

A WSGI server (meaning WSGI compliant) only receives the request from the client, pass it to the application and then send the response returned by the application to the client."
What is Fabric?	Fabric is a Python (2.5-2.7) library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks.

What tends to become an issue as you add services in a datacenter and have to ping more caches and services to fulfill a request?	Fan-in, where you can overload routers due to increased internal network traffic.
What can Redis be used for?	"- a noSQL key-value store
- caches
- queues"
What is a benefit of sharding a database as it grows, and what determines the size?	Keeping the index in cache ensures a user lookup doesn't have to hit the disk, lookups can be served from RAM. How much RAM you have will determine the index size which will hint at the underlying data size.
Why do most businesses end up sharding as they scale?	To support massive concurrent writes.
What is a message broker?	Message broker is an intermediary program module that translates a message from the formal messaging protocol of the sender to the formal messaging protocol of the receiver.

What is the problem that serialization introduces?	The overhead of serializing and deserializing. It's all expensive, and for Python, it can be terribly slow.
What does the Python bisect module do?	The bisect module, part of the standard library, provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without having to sort the list after each insertion. For long lists of items with expensive comparison operations, this can be an improvement over the more common approach.
What is PycURL?	"PycURL is a Python interface to libcurl. PycURL can be used to fetch objects identified by a URL from a Python program, similar to the urllib Python module. PycURL is mature, very fast, and supports a lot of features.
PycURL is targeted at an advanced developer - if you need dozens of concurrent, fast and reliable connections or any of the sophisticated features listed above then PycURL is for you.
The main drawback of PycURL is that it is a relatively thin layer over libcurl without any of those nice Pythonic class hierarchies. This means it has a somewhat steep learning curve unless you are already familiar with libcurl's C API."
How does PycURL compare to requests?	"PycURL can handle a large number of multiple concurrent requests. When reusing connections, it can perform more than 2,000 requests per second.

pycurl takes about 73 CPU-microseconds to issue a request when reusing a connection
requests takes about 526 CPU-microseconds to issue a request when reusing a connection
pycurl takes about 165 CPU-microseconds to open a new connection and issue a request (no connection reuse), or ~92 microseconds to open
requests takes about 1078 CPU-microseconds to open a new connection and issue a request (no connection reuse), or ~552 microseconds to open"
What is ZooKeeper?	"Apache ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications. Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable. Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp on them, which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage. Even when done correctly, different implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the applications are deployed.
Has Java and C interfaces."
What is orthogonality?	"In mathematical terms, it means being perpendicular.

Orthogonality in programming language design is the ability to use various language features in arbitrary combinations with consistent results.

Orthogonality is a system design property which guarantees that modifying the technical effect produced by a component of a system neither creates nor propagates side effects to other components of the system. Typically this is achieved through the separation of concerns and encapsulation, and it is essential for feasible and compact designs of complex systems. The emergent behavior of a system consisting of components should be controlled strictly by formal definitions of its logic and not by side effects resulting from poor integration, i.e., non-orthogonal design of modules and interfaces. Orthogonality reduces testing and development time because it is easier to verify designs that neither cause side effects nor depend on them."
When dealing with scaling, how can you deal with rapidly increasing counters, like YouTube video views?	You can add randomness to a monotonic counter, because as long as people can see it is increasing somewhat monotonically, it doesn't need to be 100% accurate. And avoids need to lock it in a transaction.
What is exponential backoff and when is it used?	Binary exponential backoff or truncated binary exponential backoff refers to an algorithm used to space out repeated retransmissions of network or other service requests, often as part of congestion avoidance.
What data structure could be used to efficiently manage a leaderboard?	A b-tree where each node manages a subset of the range of the worst to best scores.
What does adding jitter in system design help you avoid?	If your system doesn’t jitter then you get thundering herds. Distributed applications are really weather systems. Debugging them is as deterministic as predicting the weather. Jitter introduces more randomness because surprisingly, things tend to stack up.
What is an example of adding jitter to a caching system?	"Cache expirations. For a popular video they cache things as best they can. The most popular video they might cache for 24 hours. If everything expires at one time then every machine will calculate the expiration at the same time. This creates a thundering herd.
By jittering you are saying randomly expire between 18-30 hours. That prevents things from stacking up. They use this all over the place. Systems have a tendency to self synchronize as operations line up and try to destroy themselves. Fascinating to watch. You get slow disk system on one machine and everybody is waiting on a request so all of a sudden all these other requests on all these other machines are completely synchronized. This happens when you have many machines and you have many events. Each one actually removes entropy from the system so you have to add some back in."
What value can you make cron or other system intervals so they don't coincide?	Use distinct prime numbers for periodicities.
What Python package provides tools for adapting or extending functions and other callable objects, without completely rewriting them?	"functools

Decorators
Comparison
Rich Comparison
Collation Order
Caching
Reducing a Data Set
Generic Functions"
What is a proxy server?	A proxy server is an intermediate piece of hardware/software that receives requests from clients and relays them to the backend origin servers. Typically, proxies are used to filter requests, log requests, or sometimes transform requests (by adding/removing headers, encrypting/decrypting, or compression).
What is collapsed forwarding?	"A proxy server can collapse the same (or similar) requests together into one request, and then return the single result to the requesting clients.

Another great way to use the proxy is to not just collapse requests for the same data, but also to collapse requests for data that is spatially close together in the origin store (consecutively on disk)."
What should be handling requests first, a proxy server or a cache?	Generally it is best to put the cache in front of the proxy. This is because the cache is serving data from memory, it is very fast, and it doesn't mind multiple requests for the same result. But if the cache was located on the other side of the proxy server, then there would be additional latency with every request before the cache, and this could hinder performance.
What are some popular proxies?	"HAProxy
Squid
Varnish"
Why do indexes tend to slow down writes?	Since you must both write the data and update the index.
What is the role of a load balancer?	The role is to distribute load across a set of nodes responsible for servicing requests. This allows multiple nodes to transparently service the same function in a system. Their main purpose is to handle a lot of simultaneous connections and route those connections to one of the request nodes, allowing the system to scale to service more requests by just adding nodes.
What is a drawback of advanced features in a load balancer?	Advanced features can make problem diagnosis cumbersome. For example, when it comes to high load situations, load balancers will remove nodes that may be slow or timing out (because of too many requests), but that only exacerbates the situation for the other nodes.
What is a benefit of adding asynchrony to a system?	It keeps clients from holding connections to servers when waiting for a response for a task that could simply be deferred. This reduces load on servers that are performing writes, for example, and lets them perform a task when ready, not on-demand.
What is the difference between a synchronous system and an asynchronous system?	"In a synchronous system, there is no differentiation between request and reply, and they therefore cannot be managed separately. In an asynchronous system the client requests a task, the service responds with a message acknowledging the task was received, and then the client can periodically check the status of the task, only requesting the result once it has completed.

While the client is waiting for an asynchronous request to be completed it is free to perform other work, even making asynchronous requests of other services."
What are some examples of well-known queue (or can act as a queue) software?	"BeanstalkD
RabbitMQ
ActiveMQ
BeanstalkD
Redis"
Does asynchronous code tend to be CPU-bound or I/O bound?	Asynchronous code tends to be CPU bound, because anything that would block is simply deferred to later, until the blocking operation completes. This means that threads in asynchronous / non-blocking applications are much more likely to use their full time quantum before the kernel scheduler preempts them.
What is the optimal number of threads?	And if there's the same number of runnable threads as there are hardware threads, the kernel is very likely to reschedule threads on the same core, which significantly helps performance.
What is the typical time slice for a process on a Linux box?	Linux kernels are often compiled with HZ=100, which entails that processes are given time slices of 10ms.
How does Linux handle CPU affinity?	Default Linux kernels don't do a good job at keeping CPU affinity, even on idle machines. You must explore alternative schedulers or use taskset or cpuset to control affinity yourself.
What is futex?	"A futex (short for ""fast userspace mutex"") is a Linux kernel system call that programmers can use to implement basic locking, or as a building block for higher-level locking abstractions such as semaphores and POSIX mutexes or condition variables."
How do context switches perform under virtualization?	On average, it's 2.5x to 3x more expensive to do a context switch when using virtualization. My guess is that this is due to the fact that the guest OS can't update the page table itself, so when it attempts to change it, the hypervisor intervenes, which causes an extra 2 context switches (one to get inside the hypervisor, one to get out, back to the guest OS).
What is a Frame Check Sequence?	The Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field is used to determine if errors occurred in the transmission and reception of the frame. Error detection is added at the Data Link layer because this is where data is transferred across the media.
How does Google handle a search request?	"Scatter/gather
In this model, the dispatcher multicast the request to all workers of the pool. Each worker will compute a local result and send it back to the dispatcher, who will consolidate them into a single response and then send back to the client."
What is an example of bulk synchronous processing?	"Parallel Graph Transformation

The main goal of Graph transformation is to modify the graph. This include modifying the properties of existing nodes and arcs, creating new arcs / nodes and removing existing arcs / nodes. The modification logic is provided by a user-defined function, which will be applied to all active nodes."
Execution Orchestrator	"This model is based on an intelligent scheduler / orchestrator to schedule ready-to-run tasks (based on a dependency graph) across a clusters of dumb workers.

example: Microsoft Dryad"
What are 2 reasons for using a load balancer?	horizontal scalability and redundancy
What are balancing methods used by load balancers?	"assignment of a request: random, round-robin, random with weighting for machine capacity, etc
matched with current status (available for requests, not responding, elevated error rate, etc)."
What are the 3 choices in load balancers? The 3 kinds, not balancing mechanisms.	"- Smart client, a software based mechanism for determining the availability of a server.
- Hardware load balancer, such as Citrix NetScaler, are remarkably expensive, and they are also ""non-trivial"" to configure.
- Software load balancer: HAProxy"
What are 2 examples of in-memory caches?	Memcached and Redis are both examples of in-memory caches
What is write-through cache?	Write-through cache directs write I/O onto cache and through to underlying permanent storage before confirming I/O completion to the host. This ensures data updates are safely stored on, for example, a shared storage array, but has the disadvantage that I/O still experiences latency based on writing to that storage. Write-through cache is good for applications that write and then re-read data frequently as data is stored in cache and results in low read latency.
What is write-back cache?	Write-back cache is where write I/O is directed to cache and completion is immediately confirmed to the host. This results in low latency and high throughput for write-intensive applications, but there is data availability exposure risk because the only copy of the written data is in cache. As we will discuss later, suppliers have added resiliency with products that duplicate writes. Users need to consider whether write-back cache solutions offer enough protection as data is exposed until it is staged to external storage. Write-back cache is the best performing solution for mixed workloads as both read and write I/O have similar response time levels.
What is read-through cache?	An item is accessed from cache, and if it's a cache miss, the data will be read from persistent storage (perhaps with a callback) and then placed into cache. The response is then sent back to the host.
What is HDFS?	Hadoop File System (HDFS) is a Java-based file system that provides scalable and reliable data storage, and it was designed to span large clusters of commodity servers.
What is Hortonworks?	Hortonworks is a software company focused on the development and support of Apache Hadoop, a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers.
What is a platform layer?	"Web applications to communicate with a platform layer which in turn communicates with your databases. 

First, separating the platform and web application allow you to scale the pieces independently. If you add a new API, you can add platform servers without adding unnecessary capacity for your web application tier. 

Second, adding a platform layer can be a way to reuse your infrastructure for multiple products or interfaces (a web application, an API, an iPhone app, etc) without writing too much redundant boilerplate code for dealing with caches, databases, etc.

Third, a sometimes underappreciated aspect of platform layers is that they make it easier to scale an organization. At their best, a platform exposes a crisp product-agnostic interface which masks implementation details. If done well, this allows multiple independent teams to develop utilizing the platform's capabilities, as well as another team implementing/optimizing the platform itself."
What is multi-homing?	Running a service across multiple datacenters.
Where is weak consistency OK?	"- caching
- VOIP
- real-time mutiplayer games"
What is the Paxos algorithm?	Paxos is a family of protocols for solving consensus in a network of unreliable processors. Consensus is the process of agreeing on one result among a group of participants. This problem becomes difficult when the participants or their communication medium may experience failures.
What problem does consistent hashing help solve?	If you're using a caching scheme like server = hash(i) mod m, and one server in the cluster drops out, consistent hashing is needed to avoid swamping your servers when all the caches need to rehash their entities.
What is the relationship between consistent hashing and memcache?	Consistent hashing can be used with memcache not even knowing about it.  It is interesting to note that it is only the client that needs to implement the consistent hashing algorithm - the memcached server is unchanged.
What are some examples of NoSQL solutions?	"Google BigTable
HBase (based on Hadoop)
Hypertable
Amazon DynamoDB
Voldemort
Cassandra
Riak
Redis
CouchDB
MongoDB"
What is Paxos an example of?	quorum-based 2PC (2 phase commit) protocol
What is MVCC?	Multiversion concurrency control (MCC or MVCC), is a concurrency control method commonly used by database management systems to provide concurrent access to the database and in programming languages to implement transactional memory.
What is the S in SOLID?	The single responsibility principle. There should never be more than one reason for a class to change. We can relate the “reason to change” to “the responsibility of the class”. So each responsibility would be an axis for change.
What does concurrent.futures do?	The concurrent.futures modules provides interfaces for running tasks using pools of thread or process workers. The APIs are the same, so applications can switch between threads and processes with minimal changes.
What is the O in SOLID?	"The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) states that the design and writing of the code should be done in a way that new functionality should be added with minimum changes in the existing code. The design should be done in a way to allow the adding of new functionality as new classes, keeping as much as possible existing code unchanged.
""open for extension / closed for modifications""

--

During the 1990s, the open/closed principle became popularly redefined to refer to the use of abstracted interfaces, where the implementations can be changed and multiple implementations could be created and polymorphically substituted for each other.

In contrast to Meyer's usage, this definition advocates inheritance from abstract base classes. Interface specifications can be reused through inheritance but implementation need not be."
What is RTTI?	run time type identification
"Which SOLID principle is ""Make all Member Variables Private."" helping to enforce?"	The open/closed principle (OCP)
What is the L in SOLID?	"The Liskov substitution principle (LSP)
We must make sure that the new derived classes just extend without replacing the functionality of old classes. Otherwise the new classes can produce undesired effects when they are used in existing program modules.

Liskov's Substitution Principle states that if a program module is using a Base class, then the reference to the Base class can be replaced with a Derived class without affecting the functionality of the program module.

This principle is just an extension of the Open Close Principle and it means that we must make sure that new derived classes are extending the base classes without changing their behavior."
What is the I in SOLID?	The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use. Instead of one fat interface many small interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods, each one serving one submodule.
What is the D in SOLID?	"Dependency inversion principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions."
What are 3 things CDNs use to ensure availability?	"Local clustering can improve fault-tolerance and scalability. Mirroring (deploying clusters in a few locations) and multihoming (using multiple ISPs to connect to the Internet). 
Clustering, mirroring, and multihoming are common approaches for sites with stringent reliability and scalability needs."
What is hyper-threading?	Hyper-threading enables a single processor core to be used for two or more concurrent executions with just a little extra hardware.
What is DMA?	DMA (Direct Memory Access) allows devices, with the help of the Northbridge, to store and receive data in RAM directly without the intervention of the CPU.
What does NUMA stand for?	Non-Uniform Memory Architecture
Where are SRAM and DRAM used?	SRAMs are used in Caches because of higher speed and DRAMs are used for main memory in a PC because of higher densities.
What is the difference between SRAM and DRAM?	DRAM stands for Dynamic Random Access Memory. It is a type of semiconductor memory in which the memory is stored in the form of a charge. Each memory cell in a DRAM is made of a transistor and a capacitor. The data is stored in the capacitor. Capacitors loose charge due to leakage and hence DRAM's are volatile devices. To keep the data in the memory, the device must be regularly refreshed whereas SRAM is static, so it will retain a value as long as power is supplied. SRAM is typically faster than DRAM since it doesn't have refresh cycles. Since each SRAM memory cell is comprised of 6 Transistors unlike a DRAM memory cell, which is comprised of 1 Transistor and 1 Capacitor, the cost per memory cell is far greater in an SRAM compared to a DRAM.
What is the difference between a CPU core and a CPU thread?	"The difference between a core and a thread is that separate cores have separate copies of (almost) all the hardware resources. The cores can run completely independently unless they are using the same resources–e.g., the connections to the outside - at the same time. Threads, on the other hand, share almost all of the processor’s resources.
Intel’s implementation of threads has only separate registers for the threads and even that is limited, some registers
are shared."
What is SMP?	"symmetric multi-processor

In symmetric multi-processor (SMP) systems the caches of the CPUs cannot work independently from each other. All processors are supposed to see the same memory content at all times. The maintenance of this uniform view of memory is called “cache coherency”."
How does a multi-processor CPU maintain cache coherency?	"- A dirty cache line is not present in any other processor’s cache.
- Clean copies of the same cache line can reside in arbitrarily many caches."
What is Colossus?	the successor to the Google File System
What is Spanner?	Spanner is a scalable, globally-distributed database designed, built, and deployed at Google. At the highest level of abstraction, it is a database that shards data across many sets of Paxos state machines in datacenters spread all over the world. Replication is used for global availability and geographic locality; clients automatically failover between replicas. Spanner automatically reshards data across machines as the amount of data or the number of servers changes, and it automatically migrates data across machines (even across datacenters) to balance load and in response to failures. Spanner is designed to scale up to millions of machines across hundreds of datacenters and trillions of database rows.
What is Marzullo's algorithm?	"Marzullo's algorithm, is an agreement algorithm used to select sources for estimating accurate time from a number of noisy time sources. A refined version of it, renamed the ""intersection algorithm"", forms part of the modern Network Time Protocol."
What is Google File System?	"A scalable distributed file system for large distributed data-intensive applications. It provides fault tolerance while running on inexpensive commodity hardware, and it delivers high aggregate performance to a large number of clients.
It deals with multi-GB and TB files by appending to files, as that is the predominant usage pattern of large data files."
What is BNF?	BNF (Backus Normal Form or Backus–Naur Form) is one of the two main notation techniques for context-free grammars, often used to describe the syntax of languages used in computing, such as computer programming languages, document formats, instruction sets and communication protocols; the other main technique for writing context-free grammars is the van Wijngaarden form.
What is MapReduce?	MapReduce, developed by Google in 2004, is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.
What is a Zipf distribution?	The Zipf distribution, sometimes referred to as the zeta distribution, is a discrete distribution commonly used in linguistics, insurance, and the modeling of rare events.
The memory addresses returned by the malloc function are typically aligned to at least ___ bytes.	8
What is AddressSanitizer?	"AddressSanitizer is a fast memory error detector. AddressSanitizer finds out-of-bounds (for heap, stack, and globals) accesses and use-after-free bugs at the cost of 73% slowdown on average and a 3.4x memory size; the tool has no false positives.
AddressSanitizer uses shadow memory to provide accurate and immediate bug detection. The conventional wisdom is that shadow memory either incurs high overhead through multi-level mapping schemes or imposes prohibitive address space requirements by occupying a large contiguous region. Our novel shadow state encoding reduces our shadow space footprint enough that we can use a simple mapping, which can be implemented with low overhead.
It has been included as a compilation option in LLVM since 3.1."
What is transitive closure?	transitive closure can be thought of as constructing a data structure that makes it possible to answer reachability questions. That is, can one get from node a to node d in one or more hops?
What is CUDA?	CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA.[1] It allows software developers and software engineers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose processing – an approach known as GPGPU. The CUDA platform is a software layer that gives direct access to the GPU's virtual instruction set and parallel computational elements, for the execution of compute kernels.[2]
What is Borg?	The first unified container-management system developed at Google. It was built to manage both long-running services and batch jobs.
What is MPM?	Within Google, MPM (Midas Package Manager) is used to build and deploy container images. It corresponds to the Docker image registry for Docker containers.
What are 3 benefits of containers?	"1. Containers encapsulate the application environment, abstracting away many details of machines and operating systems from the application developer and the deployment infrastructure.
2. Because well-designed containers and container images are scoped to a single application, managing containers means managing applications rather than machines. This shift of management APIs from machine-oriented to application oriented dramatically improves application deployment and introspection.
3. Decoupling of image and OS makes it possible to provide the same deployment environment in both development and production, which, in turn, improves deployment reliability and speeds up development by reducing inconsistencies and friction."
What is Chubby?	A distributed lock service (master election) built on Borg.
What does CSP stand for?	Communicating Sequential Processes
What is Protocol buffers?	"Protocol buffers (aka protobuf) are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. IDL-based.

You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages."
Why is using Protocol buffers better than pickling?	Python pickling doesn't deal well with schema evolution, and also doesn't work very well if you need to share data with applications written in C++ or Java.
What is gRPC?	It’s an open source framework for RPC by Google. gRPC uses HTTP/2 and Google’s own Protobuf to provide a scalable and low latency communication. With gRPC comes a new version of Protobuf (proto3) for high performance binary serialization which includes new features and is easier to use than its predecessors.
What is Redis?	Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.
What commands can be used to make a Redis queue somewhat reliable?	"LPUSH
RPOPLPUSH - pop right, pushing onto another list for processing, atomically,
BRPOPLPUSH - same as above, but blocking
RPOP

Redis is more susceptible to data loss in the event of abrupt termination or power failures."
What is RabbitMQ?	"RabbitMQ is a messaging broker - an intermediary for messaging.

Messages are routed through exchanges before arriving at queues. RabbitMQ features several built-in exchange types for typical routing logic. For more complex routing you can bind exchanges together or even write your own exchange type as a plugin.

It can be used as a durable queue, work queues, pub/sub, topic handler, and even for rpc."

The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on a single or more worker servers using multiprocessing, Eventlet, or gevent. Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the background) or synchronously (wait until ready).

The recommended message broker is RabbitMQ, but support for Redis, Beanstalk, MongoDB, CouchDB, and databases (using SQLAlchemy or the Django ORM) is also available."
What does amqp stand for?	Advanced Message Queuing Protocol
What is ZeroMQ?	"A socket-based system, can be used as a queue, pub/sub, etc.

Carries messages across inproc, IPC, TCP, TIPC, multicast.
Smart patterns like pub-sub, push-pull (pipeline), and router-dealer."
What is ActiveMQ?	Apache ActiveMQ is an open source message broker written in Java.
What is IPC?	Inter-process communication or interprocess communication (IPC) refers specifically to the mechanisms an operating system provides to allow processes it manages to share data. Typically, applications can use IPC categorized as clients and servers, where the client requests data and the server responds to client requests.
What is Kafka?	Apache Kafka is a distributed, partitioned, replicated commit log service. It provides the functionality of a messaging system, but with a unique design.
What is MessagePack?	"MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. But it's faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves.

No IDL."
What is Avro?	"Apache Avro is a data serialization system. IDL-based.
Rich data structures. 
A compact, fast, binary data format. 
A container file, to store persistent data. 
Remote procedure call (RPC).
Code generation is not required to read or write data files nor to use or implement RPC protocols. Code generation as an optional optimization, only worth implementing for statically typed languages."
What is a Bloom filter?	"A Bloom filter is a data structure used to quickly test membership in a set where the number and size of possible elements would be very large. Too large to keep in memory.
A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not, thus a Bloom filter has a 100% recall rate. In other words, a query returns either ""possibly in set"" or ""definitely not in set"". Elements can be added to the set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with a ""counting"" filter). The more elements that are added to the set, the larger the probability of false positives."
How can you easily generate multiple hashes for the same element?	"Double hashing. This method gives you as many hashes as you need:
hash(x,m) = (hasha(x) + i * hashb(x)) mod m

In Python:
import mmh3
mmh3.hash64('foo') # two 64 bit signed ints, in a tuple
now you have 2 64-bit hashes. Substituting for i gives you multiple hashes for a Bloom filter."
What is DFT?	Discrete Fourier Transform - converts a finite sequence of equally-spaced samples of a function into an equivalent-length sequence of equally-spaced samples of the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), which is a complex-valued function of frequency.
What is FFTW?	Developed at MIT, it's the Fastest Fourier Transform in the West.
What data structure allows for insert and delete in constant time?	An array, indexed by the value stored. Technically a bit vector.
What is a cache-oblivious algorithm?	"A cache-oblivious algorithm does not mean that the algorithm does not take advantage of the cache; to the contrary, it does so quite effectively. What it means is that the algorithm does not need to know the cache line size; it works effectively for all cache line sizes simultaneously, removing the need to tune or optimize for a given machine.

Optimal cache-oblivious algorithms are known for the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm, matrix multiplication, sorting, matrix transposition, and several other problems."
How can you augment a splay tree so you can find how many items are between x and y?	"Store size of subtrees at each node. 
Find x, splay to root. Each splay, insert, and delete must maintain size in node.
Find y, and along the way add up the sizes in the left subtrees, and 1 for each visited left-hand node.
Splay y to root to ensure balance."
In a maximum flow problem, what is the minimum cut?	The min cut is the maximum flow through the graph.
What is the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm?	"The Ford–Fulkerson method or Ford–Fulkerson algorithm (FFA) is a greedy algorithm that computes the maximum flow in a flow network. It is called a ""method"" instead of an ""algorithm"" as the approach to finding augmenting paths in a residual graph is not fully specified or it is specified in several implementations with different running times. The name ""Ford–Fulkerson"" is often also used for the Edmonds–Karp algorithm, which is a specialization of Ford–Fulkerson."
What is the running time for the disjoint set data structure?	"Due to merging smaller disjoint sets into larger ones (called union by rank) (during union) and performing path compression (during find), the amortized time per operation is only O(alpha(n)), where alpha(n) is the inverse of the function and A is the extremely fast-growing Ackermann function. Since alpha(n) is the inverse of this function, alpha(n) is less than 5 for all remotely practical values of n. Thus, the amortized running time per operation is effectively a small constant.

The worst-case for find() is Theta(log u) where u is the number of unions, and no finds have been done to allow for path compression yet."
In testing, what is an oracle?	Software testers and software engineers can use an oracle as a mechanism for determining whether a test has passed or failed. The use of oracles involves comparing the output(s) of the system under test, for a given test-case input, to the output(s) that the oracle determines that product should have.

What is stored in a TCB?	"registers
program counter

What is separate chaining?	"In hash table conflict resolution, each bucket is independent and has some sort of linked list of entries with the same index. The time for hash table operations is the time to find the bucket (which is constant) plus the time for the list operation.

In a good hash table, each bucket has zero or one entries, and sometimes two or three, but rarely more than that. Therefore, structures that are efficient in time and space for these cases are preferred. Structures that are efficient for a fairly large number of entries per bucket are not needed or desirable. If these cases happen often, the hashing function needs to be fixed."
What is open addressing?	"In hash table conflict resolution, all entry records are stored in the bucket array itself. When a new entry has to be inserted, the buckets are examined, starting with the hashed-to slot and proceeding in some probe sequence, until an unoccupied slot is found. When searching for an entry, the buckets are scanned in the same sequence, until either the target record is found, or an unused array slot is found, which indicates that there is no such key in the table. The name ""open addressing"" refers to the fact that the location (""address"") of the item is not determined by its hash value. (This method is also called closed hashing; it should not be confused with ""open hashing"" or ""closed addressing"" that usually mean separate chaining.)"
What is the length of the longest chain in a hash table using separate chaining?	O(1 + alpha) where alpha is the load factor, n/m.
Since uniform hashing is difficult to achieve in practice, what is a great alternative?	double hashing

What is a suffix tree?	"A suffix tree is a compressed trie containing all the suffixes of the given text as their keys and positions in the text as their values. Suffix trees allow particularly fast implementations of many important string operations.

The construction of such a tree for the string S takes time and space linear in the length of S. Once constructed, several operations can be performed quickly, for instance locating a substring in S, locating a substring if a certain number of mistakes are allowed, locating matches for a regular expression pattern etc. Suffix trees also provide one of the first linear-time solutions for the longest common substring problem. These speedups come at a cost: storing a string's suffix tree typically requires significantly more space than storing the string itself."

How can you optimize finding a pivot when the segment to pivot is large (not random choice)?	Choose a median of three.
What is counting sort?	Counting sort is an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence. Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum key values, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items. However, it is often used as a subroutine in another sorting algorithm, radix sort, that can handle larger keys more efficiently.
What is radix sort?	"Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by the individual digits which share the same significant position and value. 
Two classifications of radix sorts are least significant digit (LSD) radix sorts and most significant digit (MSD) radix sorts. LSD radix sorts process the integer representations starting from the least digit and move towards the most significant digit. MSD radix sorts work the other way around."

To save memory, round sqrt(n) down to the next power of 2. Twice as many passes."
What operations are a treap optimized for?	"- union

What is the Day–Stout–Warren (DSW) algorithm?	The Day–Stout–Warren (DSW) algorithm is a method for efficiently balancing binary search trees — that is, decreasing their height to O(log n) nodes, where n is the total number of nodes. Unlike a self-balancing binary search tree, it does not do this incrementally during each operation, but periodically, so that its cost can be amortized over many operations.

It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as it finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph adding increasing cost arcs at each step. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. If the graph is not connected, then it finds a minimum spanning forest (a minimum spanning tree for each connected component).

What is a TLB?	A translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is a cache that memory management hardware uses to improve virtual address translation speed. The majority of desktop, laptop, and server processors includes one or more TLBs in the memory management hardware, and it is nearly always present in any hardware that utilizes paged or segmented virtual memory.
In a direct mapped or set associative cache, what is special about the cache size?	Main memory is divided into pages, and a memory page maps directly to the cache way size. So an item in a cache page can be mapped to any one of 8 cache ways in an 8-way associative cache. A direct mapped cache simply has one cache way, but it works the same way.

Fast search is made possible by maintaining a linked hierarchy of subsequences, with each successive subsequence skipping over fewer elements than the previous one. Searching starts in the sparsest subsequence until two consecutive elements have been found, one smaller and one larger than or equal to the element searched for.

A skip list is built in layers. The bottom layer is an ordinary ordered linked list. Each higher layer acts as an ""express lane"" for the lists below, where an element in layer i appears in layer i+1 with some fixed probability p (two commonly used values for p are 1/2 or 1/4)."

- Jarvis march (gift-wrapping method)"
How does a Graham scan work in finding convex hull?	At O(n log n), uses a sort and then a simple single pass of all the points, and making only left turns as it goes around the perimeter counter-clockwise.

This is possible whenever the data to be sorted is small enough to all be held in the main memory. For sorting larger datasets, it may be necessary to hold only a chunk of data in memory at a time, since it won't all fit. The rest of the data is normally held on some larger, but slower medium, like a hard-disk. Any reading or writing of data to and from this slower media can slow the sortation process considerably.
What is external sorting?	"External sorting is a term for a class of sorting algorithms that can handle massive amounts of data. External sorting is required when the data being sorted do not fit into the main memory of a computing device (usually RAM) and instead they must reside in the slower external memory (usually a hard drive). External sorting typically uses a hybrid sort-merge strategy. In the sorting phase, chunks of data small enough to fit in main memory are read, sorted, and written out to a temporary file. In the merge phase, the sorted subfiles are combined into a single larger file.

Mergesort is typically preferred."

What is dispersion?	Dispersion refers to measures of how spread out our data is. Typically they’re statistics for which values near zero signify not spread out at all and for which large values (whatever that means) signify very spread out.
What is covariance?	The mean value of the product of the deviations of two variates from their respective means.
What is a random variable?	"A random variable is a variable whose possible values have an associated probability distribution.

A very simple random variable equals 1 if a coin flip turns up heads and 0 if the flip turns up tails. A more complicated one might measure the number of heads observed when flipping a coin 10 times or a value picked from range(10) where each number is equally likely."
What is PCA and what is it used for?	Principal component analysis. We use it to extract one or more dimensions that capture as much of the variation in the data as possible.
What is a model?	A specification of a mathematical (or probabilistic) relationship that exists between different variables.
What is machine learning?	Creating and using models that are learned from data.
What is the degree of a vertex?	The number of edges incident of the vertex, with loops counted twice.
What is quick select?	A selection algorithm to find the kth smallest element in an unordered list. Quickselect uses the same overall approach as quicksort, choosing one element as a pivot and partitioning the data in two based on the pivot, accordingly as less than or greater than the pivot. However, instead of recursing into both sides, as in quicksort, quickselect only recurses into one side - the side with the element it is searching for. This reduces the average complexity from O(n log n) to O(n).
What is preemption?	Preemption is the act of temporarily interrupting a task being carried out by a computer system, without requiring its cooperation, and with the intention of resuming the task at a later time. Such a change is known as a context switch.
What is an inverted index?	An index data structure storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in a database file, or in a document or a set of documents (named in contrast to a Forward Index, which maps from documents to content). The purpose of an inverted index is to allow fast full text searches, at a cost of increased processing when a document is added to the database.
What is set partition?	A partitioning of elements of some universal set into a collection of disjointed subsets. Thus, each element must be in exactly one subset.
What is a maximum spanning tree?	A spanning tree of a weighted graph having maximum weight. It can be computed by negating the edges and running either Prim's or Kruskal's algorithms.
What is a minimum product spanning tree and when would you use it?	"The cost of a tree is the product of all the edge weights in the tree, instead of the sum of the weights. Since log(a*b) = log(a) + log(b), the minimum spanning tree on a graph whose edge weights are replaced with their logarithms gives the minimum product spanning tree on the original graph.
You would use it to minimize the product."
What is a rolling hash?	"A rolling hash (also known as a rolling checksum) is a hash function where the input is hashed in a window that moves through the input.

One of the main applications is the Rabin-Karp string search algorithm, which uses the rolling hash."
What is the Euclidean GCD algorithm in Python?	"def gcd(a, b):
    while a:
        b, a = a, b % a
    return b"
What is the Rabin-Karp algorithm?	Compute hash codes of each substring whose length is the length of s, such as a function with the property that the hash code of a string is an additive function of each individual character. Get the hash code of a sliding window of characters and compare if the hash matches.
What is sharding?	Sharding is a type of database partitioning that separates very large databases the into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts called data shards.
What is von Neumann Architecture?	"A model for modern computer organization created by John von Neumann, that had two main features:
1) Both data & instructions are stored in the same place
2) Units that store information are different from units that process information"
What is the fetch-execute cycle?	"A 4 part system that describes how actions are performed in the CPU. There are 4 parts to this cycle:
1) Fetch instructions
2) Decode instructions
3) Get data if needed
4) Execute the instructions"
What does a Control Unit (CU) do?	Controls, organizes and deals with all the process and instruction the CPU receives. It is also in charge of the Fetch-Execute Cycle. Has two special purpose registers: the Instruction Register and the Program Counter.
What is the time complexity of breadth-first search?	"O(m + n) 
uses queue"
What is the time complexity of breadth-first search?	"O(m + n) 
uses stack"

What is the time and space complexity of Bellman-Ford?	"Time : O (|V| |E|) or Theta(n^3) 
Space: O (|V|)"
What is the Bellman–Ford algorithm?	An algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph. It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers.
What is a Hamiltonian cycle?	"Given an undirected graph G = (V, E), does there exist a simple
cycle Γ that contains every node in V ?
Certificate is a permutation of the n nodes, contain each node in v exactly once, there is an edge btw each pair of adj nodes in the permutation."

How would you divide up a data set for training and testing?	Split your data set, so that two-thirds of it is used to train the model, after which we test/measure the model’s performance on the remaining third.
How would you split up a data set in order to choose from multiple models?	In such a situation, you should split the data into three parts: a training set for building models, a validation set for choosing among trained models (called the cross-validation set), and a test set for judging the final model.
What is a Type 1 error?	A false positive
What is a Type 2 error?	A false negative
In statistics, how would you calculate precision?	true_pos / (true_pos + false_pos)
In statistics, how would you calculate recall?	true_pos / (true_pos + false_neg)
In statistics, what does precision measure?	Precision measures how accurate our positive predictions are.

How would you calculate the F1 score?	2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall)
What is another name for the F1 score?	the harmonic mean of precision and recall
What is the trade-off between precision and recall?	"A model that predicts “yes” when it’s even a little bit confident will probably have a high recall but a low precision; a model that predicts “yes” only when it’s extremely confident is likely to have a low recall and a high precision.

Alternatively, you can think of this as a trade-off between false positives and false negatives. Saying “yes” too often (high recall) will give you lots of false positives; saying “no” too often will give you lots of false negatives (high precision)."
High bias and low variance typically correspond to _______.	underfitting
Low bias but very high variance typically correspond to _______.	overfitting
What can you do when your model has high bias (which means it performs poorly even on your training data)?	One thing to try is adding more features.
What can you do if your model suffers from overfitting due to high variance?	"You can remove features. Another solution is to obtain more training examples (if you can).
Or use regularization."

Machine learning: What tends to happen with the training error in a linear model as the degree of polynomial increases?	The error decreases, but too high a degree of polynomial will cause overfitting.
Machine learning: What tends to happen with the cross-validation error in a linear model as the degree of polynomial increases?	It starts high (high bias) and decreases, reaching a minimum, and then increases (high variance).
